      <h2>Chilly Gonzales - The Tourist</h2>
      <h5>June 21, 2021</h5>
      <p>Some classmates and I from Cornell Tech were taking the F train back from Brooklyn to Roosevelt Island. When we saw the skyline of Manhattan through the train window, we jumped to take pictures. Some ladies on the subway (probably locals) were making fun of us but also said something that made me think, "I pass by this sight every day and don't really think much of it, but these kids are so excited by it."
      <br> 
      <br>
      People look down on tourists, but most of us are probably tourists in 95% of the world. As a tourist, you notice and see things from a lens that most people can't see, since they've seen it so many times they take it for granted. I think being a tourist and staying a tourist throughout your life helps you appreciate the world. But idk... if I saw some people take pics out a BART window I'd probably react the same way as those women lol. </p>

      <p>Two songs I did over quarantine. Social media and music are weird nowadays. When you get that many songs and that much information coming at you all the time, you can miss the things you actually care about, or want to care about. Conversations about how I need to do a "TikTok" song if I want to actually make it &#129300. Do I want to "make it"? "I ask cause I'm not sure, does anybody make real shit anymore?" - 2007 ye</p>

          <h3>Kanye West - POWER</h3>
          <p> 
            Where it all started. When I was in elementary school, I used to press the power button on our Windows XP computer and wait 5 minutes for it to boot up. I would run downstairs, ask my dad to enter the password, and wait another 5 minutes for all the random pop-ups to show up on the screen. The pop-ups used to annoy me so much and I would instantly close most of them, except for iTunes. I would see all these unique album covers and feel the energy new artists were bringing every week. Most of the time the iTunes banners didn't catch my attention, but one day, the cover you see above was the first banner displayed. It wasn't trying to be friendly or seduce me, it was Kanye's bloody head with a sword through it. I was intrigued and shoutout to the fans, it was #1 on the charts. It was enough to make me press play on the 60 second snippet... rest is history.

          <h3>Weather Report - Birdland</h3>
          <p>
            Honestly, I thought the name of this song was "Birdman", a nickname we used to call one of my friends in middle school. This song is amazing, but for me, the meaning of the song comes from the people I associate it with. I used to play percussion in middle school with the most amazing, intelligent music teacher, Mr. Conway. He would always put so much time and effort into making us the best musicians and people we could be. I played the drumset in our middle school jazz ensemble and we picked this song to play for one of our competitions. Sheesh. The drum pattern is fun and intense, but also repititive and strenous. It's played in 4/4 time at like 150-160 BPM, and you're hitting a rim click and opening/closing the hi-hat on every 1 and 3. You're also tapping the hi-hat every beat and playing a kick pattern. The song is pretty long and playing it basically drilled rhythm into my head. It was fun though. Miss jamming out.

          <h3>Kendrick Lamar - Ignorance is Bliss</h3>
          <p> 
            There's a song called "The Heart Part 3" by Kendrick. Give that a listen if you get the chance. To be honest, I haven't heard another artist put as much energy and life into their work as Kendrick. Like ok you want it bad, but do you really? The way Kendrick raps it's as if there is no alternative. There is no backup. This is it, it's do or die. I heard this song when I was in my early teens. People always talked about the "golden-era" rappers like 2Pac and Biggie, but they didn't really connect with me. Eminem kinda did, but when I heard this song I found what I was looking for. Wordplay, lyricism, flow, and a real message over a futuristic, smooth, but hard instrumental. "Willie B I'm a fool on your beats, I bleed out the speaker as the speaker that spoke when they didn't speak." I've probably listened to this song every year for the past 10 years to remind myself to keep going harder.

          <h3>Drake - Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2</h3>
          <p> 
            I was just getting into music and after hearing All Me and The Motion, I was so excited for what Drake was going to do on this album. As we got off the plane from a family vacation in Hawaii, I kept refreshing my iPhone 4 (or iTouch) to see what Drake had announced. He had just released the album cover, which was him and his younger self looking at one another on a backdrop of clouds in a light blue sky. I was soooo hyped. It's crazy to say but I'm still getting into to this album in 2020. There are so many moments, like Chilly Gonzales's and Jhene's performance on "From Time", the 3 beat switches crafted by 40 on "Tuscan Leather", and Drake's openness on songs like "Furthest Thing". But the last song on the album, this 7-minute closer, I don't even know what to say. Ambitious, atmospheric, and just bars on bars on bars. "You never know it could happen to you, and I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Buggati, and did that shit cause it's something to do." This song, and the album as a whole, put Drake among my top 3 artists of all time and made me even more interested in the art of music and storytelling.

          <h3>Kanye West & JAY-Z - Gotta Have It</h3>
          <p> 
            I used to do taekwondo. To achieve a certain rank, we had to perform a weapons open form over any song of our choosing. I was going through song choices, but I kept coming back to this song off Watch the Throne. It made me feel like I could do anything. When I actually did my open form, I didn't place or do as well as I could have. I should've practiced more and spent more time on the details, but it was cool hearing the song on big speakers. Looking back on it though, I see why I liked the song so much. Kanye and Jay going back forth over Neptunes prodution make it a special collaboration. All my favorites together! Watch the Throne is next level and goes to show what people are capable of when they work together. By combining their talents, they made something bigger and better than what they would've been capable of making themselves.

          <h3>Kid Cudi - Soundtrack 2 My Life</h3>
          <p>
          This is one of the realest, most honest songs I've ever heard. Honestly, Kid Cudi was probably the first artist I ever got into. I always had skinny legs and didn't like baggy pants, which were in back then. Kid Cudi was the first "rapper" to wear a hoodie, glasses, and 501 Levi's jeans on the world stage. More importantly, he was really true to himself. He made music that didn't fit a single genre, wore what he wanted to wear, and said whatever was on his mind. I also felt like I could relate to him. I thought, if he could wear skinnier jeans maybe I could too (haha). Songs like "Soundtrack 2 My Life", "Up Up and Away", and the classic "Pursuit of Happiness" were some of the first songs that I chose to listen to outside of whatever my parents were playing on the radio. Glad to have Cudi as one of the first people to inspire me, Pete Davidson, Jaden Smith, Travis Scott, and so many others.
